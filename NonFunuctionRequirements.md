Non-Functional Requirements: Requirements for implementing AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery Techniques in Western Cape Hospitals

1. Usability
- The system shall provide an AI-assisted troubleshooting assistant to guide IT staff through database recovery processes.
- The system shall support multiple languages to accommodate hospital staff with different language preferences.
- The user interface shall include real-time notifications and alerts via email and SMS to keep IT staff informed about system failures and recovery progress.

2. Deployability
- The system shall be compatible with virtualized environments, including VMware and Docker containers, to ensure flexible deployment options.
- he system shall support automated installation scripts for quick and error-free deployment across hospital infrastructure.

3. Maintainability
- The system shall support self-healing mechanisms, automatically correcting minor failures without human intervention.
- The system shall include a built-in logging and monitoring framework, allowing IT administrators to track system health and recovery events.
- The system shall provide version rollback functionality, allowing hospitals to revert to a previous stable version in case of system failures after an update.

4. Scalability
- The system shall scale to support up to 100,000 database transactions per hour without performance degradation.
- The system shall allow hospitals to dynamically allocate additional processing resources during peak hours to ensure smooth operation.

5. Security
- The system shall ensure that all database access and modifications are logged and auditable, providing traceability for compliance.
- The system shall support automatic detection and mitigation of ransomware attacks, preventing unauthorized encryption of hospital databases.
- The system shall support geographically distributed backups, ensuring that hospital data can be restored even if a local server is compromised.

6. Performance
- The system shall provide AI-driven failure prediction, alerting IT staff about potential database failures before they occur.
- The system shall ensure that backup and restoration operations do not exceed 5% of normal system CPU utilization, preventing disruption to hospital operations.
- The system shall maintain an uptime of 99.99%, ensuring continuous availability of database recovery services.

7. Reliability
- The system shall achieve a minimum uptime of 99.99%, ensuring continuous availability of database recovery services.

8. Compliance
The system shall comply with HIPAA and POPIA regulations, ensuring the secure handling of patient data in accordance with legal requirements.
