# Reflection: Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs  
## AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System  
### Western Cape Hospitals  

Balancing stakeholder needs is a challenging and often complex aspect of system development, particularly for a project like the **AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System**. Below are some of the key challenges faced during the stakeholder analysis and requirement gathering process:

### **1. Conflicting Priorities Between Stakeholders**  
One of the main challenges was balancing the priorities of hospital **IT staff** and **management**. While the IT staff wanted a system that was **easy to use** and **efficient in recovery**, management focused more on **cost-effectiveness** and **minimizing downtime**. These goals sometimes conflicted, as systems with higher levels of automation and AI-driven processes often come at a higher initial cost.

### **2. Regulatory and Compliance Constraints**  
**Regulatory bodies** like **HIPAA** and **POPIA** imposed strict guidelines that had to be adhered to during the recovery process, particularly around **data privacy** and **security**. This was a challenge because it meant that the system needed to have high security, encryption, and audit trails, which increased the complexity of the implementation and may have led to delays in development. Ensuring compliance without impacting performance or usability was an important balancing act.

### **3. Scalability vs. Performance**  
Ensuring that the system could handle **large-scale recovery operations** across multiple hospitals while maintaining **performance standards** posed another challenge. The system had to scale effectively across different hospital environments, each with varying levels of resources. Ensuring that the system **performed quickly** and **handled multiple concurrent recoveries** required advanced infrastructure planning, but it had to be done without sacrificing speed or efficiency.

### **4. User Accessibility vs. Complexity**  
Ensuring that the system was **user-friendly** for **hospital IT staff**, while also providing powerful AI-driven recovery mechanisms, was another challenge. The system had to offer a balance between advanced features and usability, which was particularly important for users who may not be experts in AI or recovery procedures. Ensuring the system met **accessibility standards** (e.g., WCAG 2.1) added additional complexity but was necessary for inclusive usability.

### **5. Security vs. Usability**  
The need to maintain high levels of **security** (e.g., data encryption, access control) while keeping the system **easy to use** for non-technical hospital staff was another conflict that needed to be resolved. For example, implementing **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) for recovery operations might slow down the user experience, but it was a necessary trade-off to ensure that only authorized users could perform critical tasks.

### Conclusion  
In conclusion, the process of gathering and balancing stakeholder needs for this project was challenging, but it provided key insights into how complex systems must be designed to meet diverse and sometimes conflicting needs. The final system requirements reflect the careful trade-offs made to ensure that the **AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System** meets both functional goals and the non-functional quality attributes necessary for hospital environments.
