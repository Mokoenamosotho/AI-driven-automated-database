### **C4 Architectural Diagrams – Implementing AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery Techniques in Western cape hospials**

**Project Name:** Implementing AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery Techniques in Western cape hospials 

**Domain:** Healthcare IT – AI-based Database Recovery & Disaster Management

**Problem Statement:** Hospitals in the Western Cape rely on vast amounts of patient data stored in electronic health record (EHR) databases. Data loss or corruption due to cyberattacks, hardware failures, or human errors can disrupt healthcare services, leading to incorrect diagnoses, treatment delays and legal complications. Existing database recovery mechanisms are largely manual, slow and subject to errors.

This project aims to implement AI-driven automated database recovery techniques to ensure rapid data restoration, minimize downtime and improve healthcare service constancy.

**Individual Scope:**
Responsibilities in the project may include:

System Design & Architecture – Developing the system architecture for AI-based recovery.
AI Model Development – Training and implementing machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive recovery.
Integration with Hospital Databases – Ensuring compatibility with existing hospital database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
Automation of Recovery Processes – Implementing AI-driven rollback, backup validation and automated failover techniques.
Security & Compliance – Ensuring adherence to data security laws like POPIA and hospital regulations.
Testing & Performance Optimization – Conducting performance tests and optimizing recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives.

**1. Context Diagram (C1)** 

Actors:
- Hospital IT Admins Manage databases and recovery
- Medical Staff Use hospital applications that rely on databases
- AI-Based Recovery System Monitors, detects failures and recovers databases
- Cloud or On-Premise Databases Patient records, billing, prescriptions.
Interactions:
- Medical staff interact with hospital systems → hospital systems rely on databases → AI monitors database health → AI triggers recovery when failures occur.

**2. **Container Diagram****
- Hospital Information System stores patient and hospital data
- AI-Driven Recovery Module monitors databases and triggers recovery
- AI Monitoring Engine analyzes logs, detects errors
- Recovery Orchestrator executes recovery protocols
- Database Systems 
- Cloud-Based Backup Storage

Focuses on key components inside a specific container 

Key Components inside AI Recovery Engine:
- Abnormal Detection Module – Uses AI to detect unusual database behavior.
- Rollback Mechanism – Identifies the last stable state and rolls back.
- Automated Failover System – Switches to backup servers in case of failure.
- Backup Verification Module – Ensures database backups are not corrupted.
