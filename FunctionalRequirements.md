Functional Requirements for implementing AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery Techniques in Western Cape Hospitals.

1. Automated Backup Scheduling
Requirement: The system shall automatically create database backups at predefined intervals without manual intervention.

Acceptance Criteria: Backups must be created at least once every 24 hours, and success/failure logs must be generated for each backup attempt.

2. AI-Powered Failure Prediction
Requirement: The system shall utilize machine learning algorithms to predict potential database failures or performance degradation based on historical data.

Acceptance Criteria: The system must alert the IT team at least 24 hours before any predicted failure, with at least 95% accuracy based on historical trends.

3. Automated Data Recovery
Requirement: The system shall automatically initiate database recovery in the event of a failure, restoring data from the most recent valid backup.

Acceptance Criteria: The recovery process must be completed within the specified Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 30 minutes, with no loss of data exceeding the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 1 hour.

4. Anomaly Detection and Alerting
Requirement: The system shall continuously monitor database activity and detect anomalies, such as unauthorized access or abnormal query performance.

Acceptance Criteria: The system must issue an alert to IT staff within 5 minutes of detecting any anomaly, and logs must capture the type, time, and severity of the anomaly.

5. Manual Override for Recovery Process
Requirement: The system shall allow IT staff to manually initiate or pause the automated recovery process if necessary.

Acceptance Criteria: IT staff must be able to trigger recovery processes from a secure web interface, with confirmation of success or failure within 10 minutes.

6. Data Encryption During Backup and Recovery
Requirement: The system shall encrypt all data during backup and recovery processes to ensure patient data confidentiality.

Acceptance Criteria: All backup and recovery operations must use AES-256 encryption or equivalent, with encryption keys stored securely in accordance with hospital data protection policies.

7. Real-Time Database Health Monitoring
Requirement: The system shall provide real-time monitoring of the databaseâ€™s health, including storage utilization, query performance, and transaction logs.

Acceptance Criteria: The system must display up-to-date health metrics on a dashboard, with alerts triggered if any health parameter exceeds threshold limits.

8. Audit Trails for Backup and Recovery Activities
Requirement: The system shall maintain an audit trail for all backup and recovery activities, including user actions and system-generated events.

Acceptance Criteria: The audit trail must be retained for at least 12 months, and the system must allow authorized personnel to generate reports on backup and recovery history.

9. Compliance with Data Protection Regulations (POPIA)
Requirement: The system shall ensure that all data recovery processes comply with South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA).

Acceptance Criteria: The system must provide logs and reports verifying compliance, including consent management for patient data and data retention policies, for audit purposes.

10. AI Model Update and Learning
Requirement: The system shall automatically update AI models for database recovery, incorporating new patterns from database performance metrics and incident reports.

Acceptance Criteria: The AI models must be updated at least once every 30 days, and updates must be verified for accuracy with a 95% success rate in predicting recovery needs.
