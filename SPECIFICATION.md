**Project name:** Implementing AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery Techniques in Western Cape Hospitals

**Domain:** Healthcare Database Management & AI-Driven Data Recovery – This project falls under database administration, artificial intelligence and system recovery. It focuses on integrating AI and machine learning with MySQL to enhance database resilience, automate recovery and reduce downtime.

**Problem statement:**  Hospitals in the Western Cape rely heavily on databases to store critical patient records, treatment histories and administrative data. These databases are vulnerable to failures caused by cyberattacks, hardware malfunctions, human errors, and natural disasters. Traditional database recovery techniques are often slow, manual and inefficient, leading to potential data loss, downtime and disruptions in patient care.

This project aims to implement an AI-driven automated database recovery system that can detect failures in real time, predict potential data loss risks and autonomously restore lost or corrupted data with minimal human intervention. By using or implementing machine learning models, this system will enhance the resilience, efficiency and security of hospital databases, ensuring uninterrupted access to critical patient information.

 **Individual scope:** 

This project will consist of:
- AI-based anomaly detection to predict failures before they occur.
- Automated backup scheduling & optimization using AI-driven decision-making.
- Self-recovery database mechanisms that detect corruption and apply intelligent rollbacks.
- Automated failover & high availability ensuring zero downtime in case of failures.
- Security & compliance integration to detect unauthorized access and prevent SQL injection attacks.

my scope will also includes:
